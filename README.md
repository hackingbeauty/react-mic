# React-Mic

Record a user's voice and display as an oscillation (or frequency bars).

Plug-n-play component for React apps.

Audio is saved as [WebM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebM) audio file format.  Works via the HTML5 MediaRecorder API ([currently only available in Chrome & Firefox](https://caniuse.com/#search=MediaRecorder)).

**PLEASE NOTE**: The WebM audio format is not supported in Safari browsers (including Safari on iOS).  You need to save an audio recording as an MP3 or WAV file in order to get full cross-browser and cross-device support.

You can do that with the premium enhancement of this component called [React-Mic-Gold](https://react-mic-gold.professionalreactapp.com/sales-page34701298).

Companies that develop speech-recognition apps, voice-activated software, apps that require audio recording features, or language-learning products all use React-Mic-Gold.

    }
  }

  startRecording = () => {
    this.setState({ record: true });
  }

  stopRecording = () => {
    this.setState({ record: false });
  }

  onData(recordedBlob) {
    console.log('chunk of real-time data is: ', recordedBlob);
  }

  onStop(recordedBlob) {
    console.log('recordedBlob is: ', recordedBlob);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <ReactMic
          record={this.state.record}
          className="sound-wave"
          onStop={this.onStop}
          onData={this.onData}
          strokeColor="#000000"

# React-Mic-Gold

![Voice Record Pro](https://professionalreactapp.com/assets/images/react-mic-gold-voice-record-pro-iphone-encased-small.png)

Get your copy of React-Mic-Gold, the premium enhanced version of React-Mic [here](https://react-mic-gold.professionalreactapp.com/sales-page34701298).

[React-Mic-Gold](https://react-mic-gold.professionalreactapp.com/sales-page34701298) lets you record audio as either MP3 or WAV files.  The MP3 audio file format is super compressed which will result in small file sizes, and is widely supported across all devices.  The WAV audio file format is uncompressed and is used when you need professional quality audio; however, the file size is *significantly* larger.

## Demos

Check out the simple demo of React-Mic-Gold in action [here](https://hackingbeauty.github.io/react-mic-gold/).

Also, check out React-Mic-Gold integrated into an actual app [here](https://voicerecordpro.com/#/record).

## Details

In React-Mic-Gold, encoding of recorded audio into MP3 format happens in the browser, via a combination of advanced Web technologies (Web Workers and Web Assembly).

You won't have to continuously stream audio data to your back-end server or API endpoint to convert captured audio into an MP3 file.  Althought you can if you want to.

React-Mic-Gold also comes with an optional pause feature and additional [premium enhancements](https://react-mic-gold.professionalreactapp.com/sales-page34701298).

# React-Mic-Plus

If you need a version of this React component that only supports the WAV audio format on every device (iOS + Android), you can purchase [React-Mic-Plus](https://react-mic-plus.professionalreactapp.com).

React-Mic-Plus also comes with an optional pause feature and additional [premium enhancements](https://react-mic-plus.professionalreactapp.com).

**PLEASE NOTE**: Apple does not allow audio recording from the Chrome browser on Iphone/iOS.  To record audio from a web application on an Iphone, a user must use the Safari browser.  There is no way around this.

# Professional React Training Workshop

When I was learning how to develop apps with React, I didn't have a mentor.  I just learned everything through years of experience.

Of course, that entailed making a lot of mistakes and incurring technical debt.

But that doesn't have to be you.  You can master React development in less than 1/2 the time by getting the right guidance.

Sign up for my exciting new training program at [ProfessionalReactApp.com](https://professionalreactapp.com/special-offer), and I'll show you how companies create their software applications that make millions.

The training program is FILLED with good information that will help you either a) get a job or b) create your own applications using the insanely popular React.js ecosystem.

My name is Mark, I'm the creator of [React-Mic](https://hackingbeauty.github.io/react-mic/) and [React-Mic-Gold](https://react-mic-gold.professionalreactapp.com/sales-page34701298) , and I'd be honored to be your mentor.

I strongly believe that the only way to learn is by doing.

And the way I transform my students from novice to proficient is by teaching them how to develop and design an app I call [Voice Record Pro](https://voicerecordpro.com/).

It's the fastest way I can get you to becoming proficient because you're actually developing a REAL production-ready app.  One that you'd get paid to develop in the industry.

I hope to meet you at the [training](https://professionalreactapp.com/special-offer)!
